## PW Protect Folders By DmX


</div>

### Description

This program will protect folders from being opened without a password. The only problem with this is that it won't werk if the folder has been renamed! If you know the code to protect a folder from being renamed then please Im me(xMEminemMx) or e-mail me(DMXXMD44@fcmail.com). I really didn't want to post this up here because instead of people voting or commenting on it they will jus d/l and steal the code and change some stuff and say they made it, I spent a lot of time debugging and fixing this to werk so please if you like the code then vote for it and use it for what ever you like, also please send in comments.
